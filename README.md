# Daily Coding Problem 2019-08-13

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Jane Street._

_Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency._

_There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities._
